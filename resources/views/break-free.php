<h1 class="presentation-title-oclock">Break Free /!\ Design en chantier /!\</h1>
<h2 class="presentation-subtitle">Timing</h2>
<p>This is my second personal project. I worked on it during the month of November 2019.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 class="presentation-subtitle">About</h2>
<p>I started this project because I was curious about basic videogames design. I first followed <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript'>this mozilla tutorial</a>. </p>
<p>Then I adapted the code to organize it differently, created variables enabling to design different levels quickly.</p>
<p>And I added new functionalities : an input request to get the name of the player, 4 levels of difficulty, a connection to a database to send the score of the player, and to display the top 20 scores for each level.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 class="presentation-subtitle">Concepts used</h2>
<p>JavaScript</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>SQL - Databases</p>
