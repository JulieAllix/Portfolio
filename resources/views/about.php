                        <p>Hello, my name is Julie and I'm a French Web Developer. I love all kind of <strong>creative</strong> activities: after having experimented drawing, doing Photoshop designs, sewing, I now express my creativity by coding. I also love dogs and pineapple pizza !</p>
                        <p>After getting my Master's degree from a Business School, I started my career in 2015 in the Supply Chain as a Distribution Planner for Saint Laurent Paris. Very quickly, I started learning Visual Basics in order to automatize my weekly reports on Excel. That's how I discovered my passion for coding.</p>
                        <p>I see any coding challenge like a <strong>riddle</strong> to solve. I'm addicted to the rewarding feeling I get when I solve a bug (even pineapple pizza doesn't taste so good).</p>
                        <p>I started learning on my own on OpenClassrooms.com, and decided in 2019 to pursue my dream of turning this passion into my job. In October 2019, I started a full-time five-months-training with O'clock and moved from Paris to Barcelona.</p>
